### 🛠 My Creations
I'm the developer behind browserkun! I experiment with cool ideas to extend Google's applications, including...
* [Backgrounds for Chrome-Chan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backgrounds-for-chrome-ch/pehkblbamonighkbeeblaolnpcdpegoe?hl=en&authuser=1): A Chrome Extension for setting random wallpapers for new tabs!
* [PlusPlus](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/plusplus/441509248986): A Google Docs Extension to open a code editor right inside Google Docs!

Google hasn't hired me so I've taken matters into my own hands 😤
