## Hi! I'm Dennis 👋
### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
I'm currently...
* 🎓 Studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, graduating April 2025 
* 📈 Interested in database technologies, and all things data
* 📚 Grinding through Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
* 🎹 Picking up the piano again and 🏸 playing a lot of badminton
* 💼 Looking for a Summer 2024 internship!
### 🛠 My Creations
I'm the developer behind browserkun! I experiment with cool ideas to extend Google's applications, including...
* [Backgrounds for Chrome-Chan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backgrounds-for-chrome-ch/pehkblbamonighkbeeblaolnpcdpegoe?hl=en&authuser=1): A Chrome Extension for setting random wallpapers for new tabs!
* [PlusPlus](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/plusplus/441509248986): A Google Docs Extension to open a code editor right inside Google Docs!\

Google hasn't hired me so I've taken matters into my own hands 😤
